# museeks
A music player, in active development. The code is still a bit messy, I'm working on it.

It will use:
* [io.js](http://iojs.org/) for back-end
* [electron (used to be atom-shell)](https://github.com/atom/atom-shell/) for embedded browser
* [react.js](https://facebook.github.io/react/) as front-end framework
